## Event Description:
In this 60-minute seminar, you will learn about the basics of Stata and how to
best use Stata in the data analysis process. In particular, we will walk through
a simple project to demonstrate the typical workflow in Stata as well as how to
use Stata’s command syntax to achieve the following tasks:

1. Importing data
2. Cleaning data and doing basic data/variable transformation
3. Exploring data with basic visualization and descriptive statistics
4. Running statistical tests and fitting models
5. Reporting results and saving data

Along the way, we will also discuss tips and tricks to manage your research
project effectively and ensure reproducibility when using Stata.

**Prerequisites:**

* We assume no prior knowledge of using Stata but some basic knowledge/interest 
in data analysis
* Stata installed and working, preferably Stata 16 and up but older versions 
will work (If you need help with installing Stata or do not have Stata on your 
personal machine, please email Anh Do at doanh\[@\]msu.edu)
* Basic knowledge of your computer
