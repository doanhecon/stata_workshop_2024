In particular, we will walk through a simple project to demonstrate the typical workflow in Stata as well as how to use Stataâ€™s command syntax to achieve the following tasks:

1. Importing data
2. Cleaning data and doing basic data/variable transformation
3. Exploring data with basic visualization and descriptive statistics
4. Running statistical tests and fitting models
5. Reporting results and saving data

Along the way, we will also discuss tips and tricks to manage your research project effectively and ensure reproducibility when using Stata.
